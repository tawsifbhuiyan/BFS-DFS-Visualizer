# 🔍 BFS & DFS Visualizer

An **interactive Python GUI application** for visualizing **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** and **Depth-First Search (DFS)** algorithms.  
This project allows users to **draw graphs dynamically**, and with one click, watch how BFS or DFS traverses through nodes in real-time. Ideal for students, educators, and visual learners.

## 🎯 Key Features

✅ Draw custom graph nodes interactively by clicking  
✅ Connect nodes by drawing edges between them  
✅ Press BFS/DFS button to visualize traversal  
✅ Real-time animation with color-coded feedback  
✅ Clean and responsive interface with updated theme

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🛠 Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- Tkinter (usually pre-installed with Python)

### 📦 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tawsifbhuiyan/BFS-DFS-Visualizer
   

   🧠 How to Use
🖱️ Left Click anywhere on the canvas to create nodes
🔗 Right Click and drag from one node to another to create edges
📍 Click on two nodes to set Start & End (optional)
▶️ Click BFS or DFS button to begin traversal
🎨 Colors update in real-time as nodes are visited

🎨 Color Code
Color	Meaning
🟡 Yellow	Unvisited Node
🔵 Blue	Visited by DFS
🔴 Red	Visited by BFS
🟢 Green	Start Node (Optional)
⚫ Black	Traversed Edge
